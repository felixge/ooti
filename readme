Design goals
============
* Make testing as easy & fun as JS itself
* Write tests in pure JS, no DSL parsing
* Make it very easy to figure out what failed
* Run tests in async or sync mode
* Use human language for BDD style testing with spec() and define()

Todo
====
* Handle file not found
* Add command line option parser
* Implement --quite flag
* Implement --async flag
* Support async tests with regular cli output formatter
* Support for "regular" mjsunit tests
* Add cli_color output formatter
* Add support for jslint
* Load define() statements from different files
* Support for ~/.ooticonfig configuration file
* Track runtime of each individual step, test case, test and group
* Buffer stdio (maybe more confusing than helpful?)
